Capterra,0,"There are some limitations in terms of the space of your ""canvas"" and some font and shape restrictions. It's certainly not in the same category as a design tool like Photoshop but for the price it's a good option for any marketing team. We tend to use Piktochart for very specific design needs and rely on the graphics department for more complex work."
Capterra,0,I'd like if the space for Uploading images for a free user can be more than 40 Mb. It seems very less when you want to do a long one and do multiple edits. I wish they had a few more template options to pick from. 
Capterra,0,"icons available within the app are not very interesting, and many are missing, I would like to be able to customize more the graphs generated, colour management could be improved. "
Capterra,0,you can not work collaboratively unless you hire the pro team plan. 
Capterra,0,Elements can not be animated when presentations are made
Capterra,0,You really need to pay to taste the value. The free trial is very limited.
Capterra,0,"Not being able to upload custom fonts is big for us. Also, when you share a piktochart, the other person can't download it, they can only view it. This means we have to download a copy each time and upload it somewhere for them to be able to mark-up during review processes. I've found however that the design line-up is inconsistent- meaning when you're trying to align something the auto-alignment is a little wonky. Also, if you zoom in to say 300% something looks aligned, but when you zoom out to 100% there's space. I've found this inconsistency to bleed over to the pdfs as well."
Capterra,0,"I find it difficult to align things sometimes and because I use the free version it downloads with the watermark. I don't think that is a software issue so much as a user issue, but something to be aware of."
Capterra,0,"Huge downside: templates are very limited in free versions. They provide a ""lite"" version, which is half the cost of the more useful paid option. This version doesn't allow you as much freedom though, so it's hard to justify the use of more templates without the extra functionality. "
Capterra,0,"There are missing icons IMHO; I couldn't find the ""EU"" flag or ""Europe"" on the map (on its own) for an infographic, which forced me to import these images from the internet."
Capterra,0,"It is a bit slow to load the editor and update the changes, to use the animated icons and download the presentation, infographic or printable you must update to the ""pro"" payment plan."
Capterra,0,I dislike that the software branding appears so large at the bottom of the image as it can be distracting to viewers.
Capterra,0,It could do with adding the ability to preview the finished infographic based on the file type you chose as it reorients slightly to meet file type requirements.
Capterra,0,"you can not add too many elements because you can congest the content, neither should much text be added."
Capterra,0,What I did not like very much about piktochart software was how much you needed to do to make your infographic easier to make. You had to change a lot of settings to make it easier for yourself and that felt like a hassle.
Capterra,0,Sometimes these graphs can look very similar because of the templates. Maybe I just need to be more creative.
Capterra,0,"Some small things could be more intuitively, like changing fonts. Also a selection of some basic colors would help me, as I'm not good in selecting the precise place in the color matrix."
Capterra,0,"The only complaint from my side is that Vizzlo could offer more different graphics types especially for strategic planning they currently have only ""Business Model Canvas"" and ""Balanced Score Card.0"
Capterra,0,For certain types of charts I am missing fine tuning capabilities to adapt from properly to various sizes in presentations.
Capterra,0,"I really miss a mobile app for my tablet. This would give me more flexibility, esp. when I am traveling."
Capterra,0,"No deep customization possible, no possibility to enter big data, no integration with automatic data"
Capterra,0,At some graphics I would like to enter more data than possible. So can't wait to see them enlarged.
Capterra,0,It's hard to justify the cost since all spreadsheets have similar tools.
Capterra,0,"When we present files with large images, it bogs down the speed of slide changes. I would love if the optimal image size/resolution was readily available, and if the software gave you some kind of warning if the file was too large."
Capterra,0,"The interface doesn't work the same as finder or windows. Recently added search function do that helps. If you have tons of presentations and media, you have to be very organized or it will get out of hand."
Capterra,0,"Some seemingly - obvious features are missing: a search function within the library, inability to open links via mobile, some editing features from adobe products, etc."
Capterra,0,"There needs to be a search function. We have an extensive library and things are easily lost, making it difficult to sort through. It's a great software, but this has been a big problem in the past."
Capterra,0,There seems to be some limitations in how to format some transitions. There also was a learning curve to use some of the features.
Capterra,0,"I like the fact how its easy to customize elements, and add video. The creation of presentations are seamless."
Capterra,0,"Sometimes it will crash unexpectedly, also there needs to be an export text option for transferring a presentation to a powerpoint."
Capterra,0,I find it difficult to use and not user friendly. I find a lot of co workers using Powerpoint instead because it is easier to use.
Capterra,0,"There are key features that I feel are missing. Nonetheless I have spoken to them several times and they've said to me that all of the features I mentioned are already on the roadmap of the product, in fact they delivered one of those in the last update. Things like document signature deadline, live collaborative document editing, task/comment assignment to other team members when building a document. Those three are the key missing features."
Capterra,0,"Clunky interface (pretty, but not smooth). Makes it hard for us to get work done sometimes because we're waiting for the interface or having to move things around because they jump. The design philosophy and UI are great, but the UX leaves a little to be desired. Also, some refinements like keyboard shortcuts, maybe a favorite or most used bar."
Capterra,0,"It's a good standalone product and helps a lot when we have a document built and send out multiple versions. Building documents is still a little clunky. And some of those ""native"" integrations such as calendar would be great, to make it less standalone."
Capterra,0,The document editing system is a bit clunky.The lack of basic formatting options can be frustrating. 
Capterra,0,"I would like to be able to send attachments with my documentation. Many times, I have created an employee handbook, job application, Affirmative Action Program, etc., and if this was attached to my PandaDoc documentation, I would easily be able to track the changes accordingly. As I store my communications (per client) in specific folders, I would love it if I were able to have a reporting feature to combine the entire list of communications with my clients in one report for a mid-year and annual review process."
Capterra,0,"I wish we could customize how the email looked that that potential client received. It's the least attractive piece and not reflective of what the person is getting. And this is a big one... a few emails have ended up in a spam folder... which is really really bad when people are waiting on the proposal. So that's a hickey for sure. But it's so worth it, and we just follow up with a call or email ""sent the proposal, let me know what you think""..."
Capterra,0,"Sometimes when I'm editing a document, it bugs out. Like it will delete text or rearrange text or won't create an unordered list in the correct way. When this happens, I close out of the window and come back to it. When I send contracts out to people through panda, it typically ends up in their spam folder because it's coming from a panda email that is being flagged as spam. I usually have to download the document and send it which kind of defeats the purpose of using the software"
Capterra,0,"The only negative that I have about PandaDoc is that when you create items in dropdown boxes, you don't have the ability to match the font of those dropdowns with the font that you use in the rest of your document. I have heard that this might be changing soon but it does make the proposal look a bit unprofessional to have 2 different fonts used."
Capterra,0," I wish more of the templates were formatted for a standard letter sized page as often I'd like to include them as a part of handout or physical file of resources for clients. The long infographic templates, display the most information which is great for web-based sharing of information, but they are difficult to replicate if you want to share a physical version. Despite the number of icons available, I still encounter situations where I can't always find the right icon to illustrate my message and have to use other sources, e.g., Icon Finder, to identify the most appropriate visual. I do think the monthly cost of Venngage is pricey. I do recognize the annual cost would provide me with some savings, so I'll be exploring that but as Venngage probably realizes, for SB's managing cashflow if key so an large cash outlay for the annual subscription can be prohibitive when balancing that expenditure with other expenses."
Capterra,0,"I wish there were more alignment options. There is a snap to guide but I don't always find that as user friendly especially when I have multiple items on the graphic. I'd like to be able to select two or more items and then click ""align to left"" or ""align to center."" Also, it would be great to have a distribute horizontally and a distribute vertically option. This will allow me to ensure even spacing between objects."
Capterra,0,"I like your software, so the tone and intent of my following feedback is to encourage further potential improvement areas. I have two suggestions, based on my recent needs. First: when I save my designs, I would like to be able to copy and paste an existing design I have done and saved. At present, I only seem to be able to edit one of my existing designs. But sometimes I want to keep the earlier version, including its content, but add new content for another client's purpose and save this version too. Second, on some of your templates, I don't seem to turn on the grid feature. Third, I do like being able to embed a hyperlink to, for example, a website. What I want to do is use this feature, save as a PDF and email the PDF doc to a client. Eg a personal letter, with hyperlinks. But unfortunately, unless the letter is published online, for all to see, then this is not possible."
Capterra,0,"Sometimes it's a bit laggy, but you can't really complain for a subscription. Our needs are a bit niche so I'm not always able to find the kinds of icons or graphs I want, but it's usually possible to work something out with what's available by getting a bit creative."
Capterra,0,"I have yet not figured out how do you undo changes (3-4 layers backward). I am a Safari user and Venngage works better on Chrome so if that could be leveled up, it would be great. Another thing that bothers me is the fact that Venngage uses only google fonts. If I want to export any other font, I do not have an option. Because of that, I switch to Adobe when using other fonts."
Capterra,0,"Please expand the icon library (add more people). Also the swatches (number of colors you can save under your brand) is too limited. I work for different companies and I need more colors to save. The upload function for photos is abit cumbersome. I wish I could just copy a photo from a site or my computer and just paste/drag it. When creating documents that are multiple pages, I find it really annoying to have to click through the little up and down button, it would be helpful to have an adobe style scroller. The downloading of PDFs sometimes takes too long. Furthermore, sometimes when I download a infographic as a pdf, and I try to edit small typos in adobe> the fonts almost always are janky. It would be helpful to have fonts that are easy and compatible. I wish I could have different pages to have different background colors. Currently I have to create a large box and I have to expand it to cover the entire page and I have to lock it in."
Capterra,0,"I do not like how some features of this program become tricky to modify, particularly the word maps. When you don't have actual counts of words to create a word map, you have to kind of guess how many times it would appear and adjust the number multiple times to make the image appear as you wish."
,0,"Being in the UK the default 'letter' size for lots of the templates nearly always needs changing as the 'A' range is much more popular here, I have also found I need to 'oversize' work so when I down load it for printing the resolution is better."
,0,"The slowness of going back to previous edits. I have to click and wait for a load to get back to the previous design. Also, moving the boxes around, whether it's text or image, is sometimes hard."
,0,"As I use it a lot, I often think of features that would really improve the software if they were added. I suggest them to the live chat people but they rarely actually happen, which is a shame."
,0,"I did find that there is a page limitation when creating a multiple page document. So, for our annual report, I had to create separate documents save them out as PDF, then use Adobe Acrobat Pro to combine them into one PDF. While this created an extra step, it was relatively easy to do so I was terribly bothered by it."
,0," I wish there were more font options, or the ability to upload a font. Sometimes I feel limited with the options available."
,0,The thing I like least are a few of the technical issues. I wish that I could import higher resolution images in my upload and export into even higher resolution for the finished product. Sometimes diminishing the quality of the photo in order to upload it into the Venngage system means that I cannot create posters or larger-scale images because of the pixelation that would result.
,0,"There are few things I would like to see added. Icons currently are limited to 2 colors for fill. It would be great to have the ability to do more than two colors. Also, it would be great to have more options than google drive for connecting data directly to the tool. Currently I have to manually update charts that I reuse regularly."
,0,When I first started using Venngage there weren't many business reporting templates available but they have grown. I like the new power point templates that are available. I wish it was easier to brand an existing template.
,0, I really wish there was a way to share the original/native files with other users. We create infographs for some of our clients and they don't have access to them to be able to update and manage them themselves.
,0,"I don't use it as much as I should...As I've mentioned there's plenty of good stuff but the design interface is frustrating at times. There is no right click function, it is a nightmare trying to manipulate lower layers (need to drag top layers out the road first) - -just ""niggly"" things that spoil a feature rich SaaS based infographic design system. If these things could be sorted, not only would I use it more I'd also be inclined to refer others to it too."
,0,"There is no align/distribute functionality, so this is a manual process. Adding this functionality would greatly speed up the process."
,0,"I did encounter some bugs along the way, regarding text, resizing and placement, but the Customer Service was really helpful and now, I did they got rid of all the bugs, as they had some upgrades and modifications. I have to mention I had the Premium Account, therefore I had priority."
,0,"Although price point is affordable with our current version, it would be nice to be able to sort projects more efficiently. Something for us to strive for in future budgets if we decide to upgrade to the 'business' version. "
,0,"Saving and uploading files in a public manner is uncomfortable, then u have to pay to save in other ways which feels a bit like a bait and switch."
,0,Most of the images of humans or body parts are of white people. I will leave this software if this is not improved. Also It's difficult to make simple shapes like lines that don't expand in width when made longer.
,0,"I can only have 100 images in my upload folder, can't download as a print PDF, can only view one page at a time in multiple page designs, and the site doesn't automatically open new designs in a new tab. Some elements are pretty limited and I don't find this software particularly intuitive to use - I go to another programme for some designs as I can play around a little more and make more attractive designs."
,0,"Versatility - a program that can seemingly do it all. What's not to love? The price feels a little steep, and at times I notice little things that I wish it had, but all their other features provide sufficient compensation so it doesn't have a big impact."
,0,One or two key features (automatic alignment of objects) have been in development quite a long time. The jump to business pricing is too high for a sole trader like myself.
,0,"There's something about the interface that frustrates me, and I cannot put my finger on it. I find myself not finding exactly what I want/need, or getting frustrated with the UI pathways. Like I said, I prefer Canva for things like this."
,0,"There are some page limitations on templates that make them a little difficult to adapt for our uses. We have worked around this by making multiple copies that are continuations of the documents, but it seems like an easy fix. More native icons for pictographs would be great - we are an animal shelter and the animal and medicine related stuff is a little sparse."
,0,"The map tool can sometimes feel a little awkward to use, especially if you want to use just a section of that particular map."
,0,More options to really make my designs look more professional. Sometimes there is a little bit of a generic look and I feel like I don't have access to all of the graphics I would like to have.
,0,Custom corporate internal and external marketing pieces that I can create in one day. The templates are extremely helpful in assisting me with design and how to layout my ideas on paper. We can customize materials for our clients to distribute to their employees.
,0,"I think that Venngage may have downsized the number of students allowed per class since I first started using it. Since one subscription no longer covers a whole class, I have cancelled my subscription in favour of using free infographic apps. They're not as complete, but the cost was too much."
,0,"I really miss the option of adding fonts. The selection is okay, but some companies demand certain fonts."
,0,"There's not much I don't like. I found it difficult to remember where to find and how to do the spread sheet at first. If I had just done the tutorial, it would have been fine."
,0,Easy to put images/infographics on my website and Linked in. The ebooks templates make life really easy.
,0,"The only complaint I could think about is that with a Premium account, you cannot arrange your work into folders. So it's a bit hard to find past designs. It is one of the business features though."
,0,"I find it frustrating I can't drag an image in one direction without it scaling up. Sometimes I want something a little taller not wider. Sometimes things don't always exactly align or snap to. Although I think there may be a bit of user error in this one...I've recently found the show grid that might help! I would like some of the people icons to be more multicultural, they are all peach coloured."
,0,A limited number of photos and icons that are not always able to be manipulated. There are some icons I want to change colors and am unable to.
,0,"It has so many built-ins already, but because I use this so often, I would like more. I would like a feature built in that has pre-designed header backgrounds as well as more shape options."
,0," I can't think of anything to really dislike. It's done what I needed it to do. I use this program to create an annual report, and sometimes it doesn't translate well between venngage and the printer we use, but we have been able to resolve little glitches."
,0,"Every once in a while, for reasons I can't explain, some detail of design (mostly to do with fonts, I suspect) will manifest as just a little ""off"" in the export file format. Everything will render in the output exactly as it appears on the editing screen, except - mysteriously - for this one thing... It's not the end of the world, as you it can be resolved through trial and error; however it can be irritating, and this remains my one complaint about the platform."
,0,"There is no gradient option yet for background colors. Sometimes I can't find a font I am looking for. Otherwise, no cons!"
,0,"Venngage needs more icons, backgrounds, and fonts. A batch uploading tool could be helpful. Uploading one file at a time can be tedious."
,0,"I wish I could use the product off-line. It would be helpful for tweeks and updates online. Their than that, the product is wonderful! Thanks for the templates."
,0,"There's not much I don't like about Venngage. I suppose if the Pro package was cheaper, i'd be using it."
,0,"Pretty much perfect, but I'd love to see more sophisticated color options, like a fading/ombre. Also very occasionally there are elements in the pre-made templates that can't be deleted, which you don't notice until it's too late."
,0,"t's not a great collaborative tool, as I use it in a university context. I am often hired as a consultant and leave my clients with Venngage products for their teaching materials but the premium program doesn't allow you to pass the visuals on to other users to edit later. It's a significant drawback."
,0,"Maybe it is up to my computer, but sometimes it's difficult to format and place individual elements exactly. For this I have the problem that when I edit a text field, often just the text disappears and I have to rewrite the text. Although I appreciate the number of templates, it is often difficult to use the templates for my own purposes. It would be nice if the templates were a bit more flexible. For example, that you can add pages with the same formatting when planning a longer report."
,0,"Premium version is short in some basic features like organizing ""My designs"" so the user start to have a bunch of things mixed in one page. Ther is no way to organize it with just drag a drop. They say that you have to upgrade to a superior package but just for this is not worth."
,0,"Occasionally, I've experienced some glitches when editing a piece I have created. I've also found some limitations on the graphics within the system, but the ability to upload your own has really mitigated that frustration. Lastly, I would love the ability to create a report or asset with more than 5 pages, especially for items like presentations and annual reports."
,0,"Not always able to find the best icons, but can usually find something that will work. Sometimes have a hard time moving single text items, but again, can always make it work."
,0,"The only con that I have is that there doesn't seem to be an export feature for specific images that I would want to paste into a separate word, publisher, or powerpoint document."
,0,I'd like more icons to choose from. The storage area could be larger for imported graphics. I had to delete several in order to add more.
,0,"The mapping functionality is not great, particularly if you are a UK user as you aren't able to breakdown the template into regions e.g. North West, North East etc. Unfortunately this renders this part of the software unusable for our needs. Would be helpful to customise the charts further."
,0,The features and functionality are limited based on types of membership. It was not pretty friendly for users who just started to learn the functionality and the features of how to collaborate into their works.
,0,Customizing some of the templates (especially those that have a map). I live in Canada and the map visuals are all of the States.
,0,To define pros is difficult. Problems from ease of use to simple printing. It is not worth the monthly fee.
,0,Sometimes it is slow. Also when using a template they could improve the ability to customize it or to use different pieces of multiple templates.
,0," Everyone complains about not being able to do certain things unless you pay for the software, but you get what you pay for!"
,0,The iframe charges slowly in your the webpage. Sometimes it's difficult working with many elements on the canvas because it's hard to select the element.
,0,"We tend to reuse a few certain looks in our infographics. Venngage allows you to make a copy of a finished infographic, but the process is not obvious and one can easily write over a file unintentionally."
,0,Venngage really needs more photos for users to choose from when making infographics. Sometimes Venngage does not save fast enough on the website and I lose work.
,0,"I don't find the presentation templates to be that easy to use. I mostly use the infographics, but when I tried to use the presentation it wasn't as user friendly as I had hoped. I will try again though!"
,0,I wish it had vertical and horizontal rulers so you could see actual sizes when you have to design non standard sized items.
,0,The ability to name so you can distinguish between different variations of your work would be helpful.
,0,"The cost is prohibitive unless you don't rely a lot on presentations for your work .It can do with some work on it's design ,as it is hard to find the functions and icons you need ,if you don't know where to look for them ."
,0,"It does not provide a grid, but does provide ability to set-up guides to align icons, logos, pictures, text boxes, etc."
,0,"Some of the icons, images and maps are a bit limited, and you can only have a solid colour background, but nitpicking to be honest."
,0,"Price. I am a power user and I find that I've exhausted all basic and premium templates and recently saw a the ""business"" tier which is higher than premium and allows you to access even more templates. This tier didn't exist when I started using venngage so I do feel let down with this ""nickel and diming""."
,0,ease of creating personal color palettes that can be re-used over and over for new projects
,0,"A few of the features can be tricky, especially maps and printing. Overall, they do a good job labeling those things that are meant for the design professionals versus the rest of us."
,0,"It can be a little hard to use at first and know what all your options are but the learning curve isn't too steep. Additionally, It's hard to resize everything and/or move multiple things around in groups. There are some limits to the tool but overall I think it's one of the best ones out there!"
,0,The UI has a couple of non-conventional things that take a bit of time to get used to but works very well.
,0,A little pricey for my purposes. I wish it were about 1/3 of the price.
,0,"Would like to see more ""drag and drop"" templates versus those already completed."
,0," I haven't been able to find a blank template that I can use to create my own branding, but always need to modify. I wish the Premium subscription and the Business subscription allowed the same features to be used."
,0,I have nothing negative to report about using Venngage. The company exceeded my expectations and I became better with each design that I adapted.
,0," I think there could be more options. With the growing number of websites offering this service, the service could surpass others very easily."
,0,I wish Venngage had a proportion option to lock the width and height dimensions when adjusting the page size.
,0,"The cost. Also, when I create a file in Venngage I am not able to edit it in another application (ie InDesign). For my co-workers to be able to reuse or edit designs I've made, they have to be on Venngage as well."
,0,"The undo button is a nice feature, but sometimes a bit inconsistent in that it will undo one thing, or many."
,0,Perhaps there could be more clip images and more sample examples but I think as more people use it they will be added as time goes on.
,0,"Less useful for a lot of the sorts of data visualizations needed in my company. Line graphs, bar graphs and pie charts are good, but that's the limit and inputting or importing data can be laborious. Design templates in the program itself are time consuming to modify."
,0,"Icons and pictographs and other features provided that are not editable (such as color, or ability to crop). Often I go find my own icon or pictures and import them because I have more flexibility of how they look."
,0,I wish the sizing and edit option can be more sophisticated and support different font style for other languages as well.
,0,"I'd like to see more options for templates and images, especially anything related to education and schools."
,0,"Would like to be able to more easily manipulate parts of the icons, but there are basic workarounds."
,0,There could be a greater selection of symbols available and fonts. I wish the paid versions offered more symbols and fonts.
,0,"We can't always find icon graphics which match what we need. It would be helpful to have more ways to depict ""youth"" in icon form."
,0,The charts are not data driven in the sense that they are not dependants on values from a table. I believe the software would benefit from improvemet in this area.
