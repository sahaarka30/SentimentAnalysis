LinkedIn,4,Excellent tips there my friend it really makes sense. This is what is working for me. 
Capterra,4,"I love this tool. Piktochart is very intuitive and easy to use. It is especially useful to creating infographics or email banners. There is a decent level of functionality in terms of styling, colour, shapes, and transparency, with an excellent store of free images and graphics to use. You can also upload your own imagery as needed. Once you have your graphic elements chosen, it is very easy to adjust and manipulate them to create the effects you want. Our team uses this tool in place of a graphic designer for smaller projects."
Capterra,4,"The product is very easy to use. It has a decent catalog of free graphics to pull from which allows users to create visually engaging infographics, web ads, and banners. You can share or download what you've made with the click of a button. This tool is ideal for teams or departments needing basic design support without a graphic designer."
Capterra,4,"The best quality that this application has is the speed and simplicity of the application in letting you design any type of art you need at the moment. Having an easy access to the application through an email, being registered in the web page"
Capterra,4,"easiness to use, you can import data from excel or google sheets. High-quality pdf downloaded can be modified using another software (es. Illustrator), you can upload your own graphics, also to be used into graphs (svg), really great real-time customer care and troubleshooting support, many templates available."
Capterra,4," Seriously the best infographic creator out there. Piktochart got me through college! So easy to create really professional looking infographics - much better than trying to create one on Photoshop, in my opinion. The templates make it so easy to get a head start on a project and the text frames add such a splash of creativity. Love Piktochart!"
Capterra,4,The editor is very good since it provides guide lines that allow to align and adjust the elements. Has more options for editing the elements than other similar tools such as canva. It offers a variety of maps to place in the design and the possibility of adding data and legends. It allows you to include video files from YouTube and Vimeo. 
Capterra,4,"Once a presentation is published you can add transitions, I can also choose if only I can see the presentation or if I want to share it through social networks. 
allows download in png format to an acceptable quality in the free version."
Capterra,4,"It takes 0 design or dev experience to be able to jump into the tool and whip up a Grade A infographic is an hour or two. In a previous role, we were so efficient with it, we started building custom infographic plans for our customers."
Capterra,4,I love the access to the templates and icon library. The text frames are really cool as well to find new ways to make text visually attractive and include facts and figures.
Capterra,4,"I like the variety of templates as well as the ability to create my own templates for my documents. There is a wide variety of font choices, which I also appreciate. I can import my own graphics as well."
Capterra,4,"The layout is very simple to work with. As a first-time infographic creator, I've explored a variety of websites trying to find the simplest ones. This lands in the top 3. I was able to craft a infograph from a template in less than 30min, and it even allowed for me to make changes that suited my needs."
Capterra,4,"Wonderful infographics with very easy to align layout, great free design options and a very easy-to-use interface."
Capterra,4,"It is very easy to use, you learn in a very short time to use the functions of the program. It is free for most of the things that one needs to do, allows to easily make infographics, presentations, posters, flyers and reports, allows download in png format and share in social networks."
Capterra,4,This program allows us to create good quality infographics for presentations and social media quickly and completely.
Capterra,4,"It's wonderfully focused, allowing you to make some very impressive infographics without a bunch of unnecessary extra features that you'd never actually use."
Capterra,4,"You can add your own image as a background, you can add GIFs to presentations and work much better from Chrome or Firefox."
Capterra,4,My benefits in this software was the one that can be shared on social networks and I was able to add a lot of color and I liked that.
Capterra,4,What I liked most about this software called piktochart was that it did not feel overcrowded. I felt overcrowded using other infographic makers.
Capterra,4,I found it very easy to make good graphics. They make the templates very easy to fill in and make it look custom.
Capterra,4," It's very easy and very fast to use. Usually I have a rough idea in mind, and it took 5 minutes to look for a suitable template and another 5-10 minutes to fill in my data, adjust it (title, color etcetera) and download the final file to include it into my presentation. Of course, the templates are much more sophisticated than anything I could do by myself. "
Capterra,4,"I love Vizzlo! I started using it two years ago. I don't want to miss it anymore. Never since then, I even tried to build a business graphic in powerpoint. Vizzlo is my place to go if I need something that looks professional."
Capterra,4,"Creates professional, polished charts really quickly. I use Vizzlo since a few months to create diagrams and plan my projects. It's really easy and I get results that look perfect. 
Love it."
Capterra,4,"Vizzlo has a great Portfolio of charts and graphics. It's easy to use and saves so much time creating presentations. It's also kind of fun to experiment with different chart types, sometimes it really helps you to get a new perspective on the data/facts you're trying to present."
Capterra,4,"Very user friendly! Vizzlo has allowed me to manage my personal finances, by providing me with a way to easily create charts and visualize where my money goes. I can plan my financial goals effortlessly, and there is no need to mess with Excel anymore. There are so many templates available."
Capterra,4,Most of the supplied chart templates look really great and it is easy to get results very quickly without having to tinker around like with many other tools we come to loath.
Capterra,4,"Fast, easy to learn and easy to use + excellent results. Never made the charts for my presentations faster. Some of them in almost no time. "
Capterra,4,"stylish and sophisticated, ease and joy of use, vivid and colorful, manifold and diversified, reliable and experienced, beneficial and useful Love the enthusiastic newsletter that come every now and then - can feel the passion they have for the product ."
Capterra,4,"Very good platform, it has many templates for all kind of graphics I use in business. I started using Vizzlo doing project planning, meanwhile, I make all my presentations with it."
Capterra,4,"Figures. Great variatey , very user friendly and they all look great! The team and the customer service is something to note, they are great, responsive and helped me a lot in my subscription."
Capterra,4,Vizzlo supports my daily work as a Marketing Manager. I get very easy and fast nice graphics that feature my data I want to present in a pretty way.
Capterra,4,Vizzlo has a lot of different great looking templates that you can utilize to create visualizations for your data. It's super easy to modify the look of it as well.
Capterra,4,easy to use and results in great presentations. i also like that i can look at use cases which helps me in deciding which graph suits me best.
Capterra,4,"The fact that it is web-based makes it SO easy to share and update without having to ""save as."" I love that multiple people can work on a project at once."
Capterra,4,"Enhanced teamwork, cloud-based solutions, library of marketing materials, easy management of changing to materials that is trickled down."
Capterra,4,The team-work abilities with presentations & sharing. Also the Marketing control with the library slides.
Capterra,4,"Easily share presentations with coworkers or clients. When you change something in your library, all of your linked slides are automatically updated. Easily import videos & images."
Capterra,4,Love that multiple users can work on the same presentation at the same time. It is also a great feature that we are able to track when users view our presentations (when we require email entry to open the presentation) and to be able to host a meeting for other users to see.
Capterra,4,"We've been using the software for several years and it has saved us time, better positions us to win more pitches, and served as a great connection point for all of our branded assets. The price may have you think twice about it, but when you're in a marketing role, allocating a budget to the pitch stage of your company is just as important as the money invested in marketing. For us, the value we've gotten far outweighs the costs."
Capterra,4,"What I like best is the document builder features. The structure they gave to the product with the Templates and the content library I think is very useful because it lets you slightly change each document on specific sections which is something that happens a lot. I mean, templates work as a baseline document and then you can have multiple content library items that you pull in when needed."
Capterra,4,"The client-editable quotes are awesome.The UI is good (UX needs some work, below). Content re-use is great. Love the signing and notifications."
Capterra,4,"The main user interface and its components are great!The dashboard is helpful for an overview of what's in the pipeline (Sent->Viewed->Completed->Draft ... although I think draft should be first). If I am anticipating someone to review and sign a document in the next 24-48 hours, I can easily see when it is moving along the process by hitting refresh occasionally (on my web browser) without actually being in the document itself. The icons on the left navigation bar make sense after you use it for awhile (Dashboard->Documents->Templates->Catalogs->Contacts). I like how templates can quickly and easily generate documents when set up properly.The folder system is intuitive and not too cluttered."
Capterra,4,"The software is user-friendly and intuitive in that I was able to immediately pick up how to use the bells and whistles easily and without a tutorial (although tutorials are available). This is very important to me as I am a ""skimmer"" and feel that good programs should be easy, easy, easy. If I have to constantly refer to the users manual, I become frustrated and want to eliminate the program. I love the electronic signature feature - this has allowed me to execute proposals quickly. Additionally, I get proof that my clients have received the documentation I sent out - leaving absolutely no doubt that we are all on the same page regarding the advice I have given. "
Capterra,4,"We love the flexibility of designing each template and then being able to personalize it. It's central to our sales process in creating a proposal that helps close the deal as much as anything else. It's robust, beautiful and easy. It's a fantastic solution for what we do. They also provide zippy customer service. We also dig how it tracks everything. Very useful in our communication. I can't say enough about it... Love, Love, Love it!"
Capterra,4, I love being able to create ready to go templates for proposals and contracts that I use often. It also makes the proposals look BEAUTIFUL.
Capterra,4,"The user interface is easy to use and allows you to customize your proposals and add features in that were difficult before, such as video. Also, you can create your content library to drag and drop parts of your proposal that might be different or unique to each proposal, such as descriptions of products and/or services that you offer. The pricing library can be preloaded with your products and/or services so you can streamline and automate the pricing process, including the calculation of multiple items and sales tax."
Capterra,4,"Super easy! It only takes a view seconds to send out an agreement. Everything is already set up in a template and all I have to do is fill in like 2 items. I also LOVE how I can see when the customer views it, signs it, and pays it. Also love how I can see how long they spent on each page and how many times they viewed it."
Capterra,4,"The most valuable aspect of Venngage is more than the software itself, but the amazing user support I get as a subscriber! I find the weekly emails from the Venngage staff alerting me to new ways to use the templates in Venngage priceless!! Those guides help me focus my thinking, give me great inspiration for how I can illustrate my message in a compelling way and increase my confidence in developing visuals. This service really sets Venngage apart from similar tools I've used like Piktochart, Lucidchart, etc. I have found that the concepts I've learned from the Venngage team, I can apply to other apps as well (e.g., Word, PowerPoint). I also like the variety of templates available, and that I can ""deconstruct"" a template and understand how the infographic was designed so that I can create my own version of it as needed. The way the templates are categorized really help to guide the user to the best visual to use for the message being delivered. I will be a long-time user of this software."
Capterra,4,"The templates are amazing. They really help to spark creativity and are easy to adjust to my particular needs. And since they are constantly adding new templates, I can always find something that works well for my project. I also love the icon library. They are so many icons to choose from and 99.9% of the time I can find exactly what I need without looking at other stock image websites. Lastly, the learning curve is not very long. I feel that I became proficient at using Venngage in a relatively short period of time and the results have been that my work looks more polished, more professional in a shorter period of time."
Capterra,4,"To my surprise and delight, your online support was immediate. I love that as I typed, a little message popped up to say that so and so was looking and waiting for my inquiry. This simple feature instilled me with confidence that a real person was at the other end, ready to assist. Another feature I really like is the vast array of options, across all your templates and icons etc. But even more than this is, I like your labeling system. It makes my searching so easy. The ability to turn on and off various features, such as the `grid is great. I can see whether my text is lined up before I print. This saves me time and money. I also enjoy the fact that I can take your template, but still make it my own. This flexibility again saves me time, but still allows me to personalize my product as required. I find your whole suite of features so intuitive to use. A big thumbs up from me so far. Bravo Venngage."
,4,"So far, our marketing team has been relying on Venngage almost exclusively for day-to-day graphic needs on all kinds of collateral. We'll be hiring an in-house designer soon, but Venngage has been a solid go-to for over two years. I myself am not a graphic designer by any means, but this tool has helped me put together some really polished, stand-out content. Even with a designer on board, I can still see myself using Venngage here and there for stuff I want to put together quickly on my own. It offers a nice set of icon/design options. The templates are good starting points as well, or at least make decent inspiration if nothing else. I find them difficult to customize though and prefer starting with a blank canvas most of the time."
,4,"Helped us - in-house marketing team - design polished, stand-out content without a graphic designer!"
,4,"The varied options it gives is great along with being up-to-date with trends. For example, Valentine's special templates for the month of February.Secondly, the fact that it is so customizable right from the colors of the gridline to the font of the legend makes it likable. It's made my life easier with the graphs. I used to use powerpoint and excel for making charts/graphs and it was a pain. I also like the options available in icons, makes it quicker for me to not go to a third party like iconfinder.com. I used to use that software to fetch icons and freepik for vector files and merge them in Adobe Illustrator. This software solves all the 3 purposes.Lastly, I love the chat support. People are quick in replying and help solve my queries proactively."
,4,"I really enjoy the icon library. I wish the icons available particularly people increased to include more professions, different ages and different races."
,4,"This software is easy to use, modify, and create unique designs. It has multiple export formats as well, which I appreciate. The colors are bright but not obnoxious. There is a great variety of imagery to choose from and from lots of different industries. I really like that I can use Venngage to create an image as detailed as I like, and simply export as a PDF for someone else to insert in their documents or use as they like. I've had a great deal of success using the charts feature, particularly in learning applications."
,4,The templates are a great way to start an idea off - and you can use bits from different ones to create your own unique design. I often have to make more than one design to show the groups we work with and being able to make my own templates has been really useful.
,4,"I am able to do all my work, and we at CARE have used it for everything from conference bag designs to big timelines that we use at huge conference meetings. The charts have helped us with our infographics especially since previously, this used to be so expensive. I use it often and train our teams on using it in East, Central and Southern Africa but now I have been asked to train other parts of the organization to use it too - so in two weeks I am running a training for our Asia countries."
,4,"It's so easy to use, and the live chat people are so helpful. I love the versatility as you can upload your own pictures or use theirs, plus they have a load of icons you can use to create really professional-looking graphics super fast. You can also make graphs and basic polls really easily too."
,4," I appreciate the multiple templates and tools that simplify the process of creating a really awesome infographic. It takes minutes to create pages and documents that it would normally take hours to do or that I would need to outsource to a graphic designer. For the most part, I have found it simple and easy to use and pretty powerful. This ease of use combined with high quality output makes this a great tool for people like me who are not designers, but need something that create high-level output without enormous amounts of effort. Most recently, I used Venngage to create our annual report and I couldn't have been happier with the professional quality of the final product. Most importantly, it took less than a few hours of total time, including the creation of multiple chats and graphs."
,4," I love that I'm able to upload my own images and logos to really customize it for my needs. I also use the ""copy"" feature a lot, where I'll duplicate one of my past designs and edit it from there so I'm not starting from scratch. The grouping feature also makes it easy to move around whole blocks of images and text so you're not losing your spacing/placement, but can move it all up or down if you wanted to add or take away extra space."
,4,"My favorite part of Venngage is the ease of use. It is really simple to create something unique and professional grade. I use Venngage to create inforgraphics, cards for social media posts, and photo content for email blasts as well. Once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to put together designs. I often use the same templates I have created over and over again. The free images are a definite plus as well."
,4,It saves me a lot of time that I would have otherwise spent working in Adobe.
,4,"The software is super easy and intuitive to use. There are many aspects you can customize (such as adding your own company colors to the pallet - makes reuse a super easy). I like the templates for generating new ideas. The new snapping features works great. Overall, my favorite part is the customer service. I have to admit, I avoided the ""Chat with us now"" box on the side - thought maybe it was a bot. However, I really needed help one day and I used it. It is a human (or the most realistic AI on the planet). The response was immediate and provided me with exactly what I needed. I have since used it several times with the same great results. In this day and age - that level of customer service is exceptional."
,4,"My presentation look sharper and more professional. In addition, I have been able to create graphics that communicate challenging concepts in a clear and simple way."
,4,"UI is simple and clean meaning functionalities are organized and easy to find. There is a ton of premade templates, so if you are in a hurry and need something polished as soon as possible you can do it in a matter of minutes! Venngage is a platform that is regularly updated, so new templates, icons, and editing tools are constantly added. The customer support is super helpful and responds almost immediately! Every time I contacted them, my issue was solved!"
,4,"It is the best infographic maker out there! I am not sure I can list any! Venngage gave me the best experience I had with any other infographic software and believe me I tried many, though it performed all of them!"
,4,I first started using Venngage to create reports on customer insights gathered from interactions with the customer service team that I manage. I used to use excel and no one seemed to pay attention to the boring report. As soon as I started using Venngage I had so much more engagement. I now use Venngage for so many things from reporting on KPIs to making beautiful posters. There are a ton of ready to use templates that are beautiful and they are constantly posting new ones. I have zero graphic design experience and am able to create professional looking infographics that attract the attention they need. I also love the helpful tips and entertaining infographics I receive through email from Venngage. I receive a ton of emails from vendors and I actually open these ones.
,4,The templates available are spectacular! A great help when getting started on a project and easy to edit.
,4,"We can quickly put together professional looking infographs, flyers and other documents without having to spend a ton of money on software that is simply too robust for our needs (and of course you pay for that robust-ness!)"
,4,"The interface itself is fast, fresh and well laid out. Minimal clutter when choosing your desired template category and good grief there are plenty to choose from. I've only had to speak with support a couple of times and both times it was a fast and detailed response."
,4," Massive library of templates helps spur creativity so there's rarely a need to start from scratch. Built in artwork-icons, photos, fonts-is great, as is the ability to upload photos and art."
,4,"I like that you can find templates for almost all the things you like and need. You can use them as they are, just changing the text, or you can modify them as you like. I had a Premium account, therefore I benefited from all of their specifications. I mostly enjoyed the Interactive PDF as it comes very in handy when you need to present some information and send it to your clients. I also liked that they have a vast number of icons, photos and other that help you instantly. You have everything you need just a click away and that save you a lot of time. Some other great things that I only tried, didn't make use of them, was the Interactive part, where you can create polls, forms, tables. And the chart part which is more than great! It is so easy to create a nice visualization of your data and the ""wow-ness"" that you get after presenting it is amazing."
,4,Really nice and simple to create infographics and presentations that really impressed the viewers.
,4,Easy to navigate homepage and dashboard. low learning curve rate for new users (most just signed in and 'got it' right away when they were first introduced). cloud-based application allows for our travelling team to access files easily remotely. having access to Canadian based maps/regions is so incredibly valuable. It's what set Venngage apart from the other software we looking at. price point is still affordable for our non-profit budget. an abundance of graphics means we can really vary and personalize the infographics we create
,4,"Modern presentations that are well thought out and obviously produced by a talented staff. Easy to add your own icons, logos, photos. It seems the team is truly engaged in their work and listening to customers. Fun. Rewarding. Customizable colors that are cool and not just primary based. Option to use free if you just need a little something. Easy to edit text and material. Easy to add custom title to saved work. Visual icon for saved work and an option to preview or edit."
,4,"Although the site is poorly lacking in images of people of color (or body parts, such as hands, that reflect people of color), the graphics are otherwise very cool, and the templates are attractive and easy to use."
,4,"The icons, pictograms, and ability to set brand colours make this pretty easy to use. I love the snap to guide as well. The chart feature is awesome."
,4,Unbelievably versatile and surprisingly intuitive to use. Does the job of multiple applications in one easy to implement and integrate program.
,4,"Range of templates to enable me to create good quality content. Continuous updating of content and really helpful, informative & instructive blog to help me get to the next level. Excellent customer support for when I get stuck."
,4,The opportunity to create professional quality content both for my own website and for company reports which would have been too expensive to commission otherwise.
,4,"Venngage offers a fairly similar user experience to Canva, which is a big draw; it's easy to use, has gorgeous premade graphics, and enables simple manipulation to create custom graphics without needing a designer. The offerings are wide, which I really enjoy--you can create a lot of different things quickly and make them all look beautiful."
,4,The interface is so easy to use that I can allow other teammates access to projects and they can make changes and updates immediately without my having to train them. There is a huge variety of templates that we have been able to adapt for our needs and it has made a difference in the turnaround time for our projects.
,4,A quick and easy interface for media projects with a lot of native material to work with so we are not designing from scratch. Saves us so much time and effort and helps us turn out polished projects that reinforce our professional image.
,4," It is easy to use. I'm not particularly computer savvy. And I'm not a designer. But through the use of the many excellent templates that Venngage has on its site, and by observing how the 'professional' industry creates infographics, I can make smart looking images in a short period of time. It is easy to resize the graphic, and easy to download as a PDF or PNG."
,4,"Strong ROI for our firm. Customer Service is very responsive and anytime I had an issue it was resolved same day. The program is overall, very easy to use for a novice marketing person and is irreplaceable for me at this time."
,4,The education version gives students a lot of features and tools. They have professional tools for a price that is reasonable for a whole class of students. It's great that students do not have to for out additional money.
,4,"I use Venngage for presenting numbers at work, for cute Facebook posts, for greeting cards well, for almost everything. And I always get compliments for the flawless end result. I've shown Venngage to several friends who also fell in love with it. Perfect software if you work in marketing as I do. But I would also recommend it to people in non-creative fields. Spice up your reports or whatever it is! It'll be easier for the reader to take in the facts."
,4,"I could start with a tutorial(and a whole library of them), so I didn't get frustrated trying to do something, and not having it work. All the templates, and ranking them from Beginner to Advanced. Also, the grouping of the different templates, so I know where I can use them. I am a total failure with design/color, so the guidance is terrific."
,4,"The templates look very professional, so it's a good start for your infographics, ebook covers, blog banners, etc. There's a lot of icons, images, fonts and colors to choose from. Everything is very easy to use even if your not a professional graphic designer."
,4," As part of our blogging effort, we wanted to offer nice visuals like infographics or just blog banners to make our blog more attractive. Venngage has been an easy and affordable option to do so."
,4,"I like styles and designs. The finished products look like a real GD has produced them rather than me! I like I can add my own photos and images. I like chatting to the live operators, they're really friendly, quick to respond and helpful."
,4,High quality products for small price. Still regretting that I didn't upgrade to Business for your Black Friday deal. Polished results.
,4,Extremely easy to learn and use. There are so many different template options that visually show the capabilities of this software. I do a lot of marketing/advertising and this program allows me to crank out visually appealing graphics within minutes.
,4,"As a graphic designer I thought this was for those without the ability or software to design flyers. After using this one time, I realized how powerful and fast it was to use. I use it in place of my expensive Adobe software for flyers now. It just make sense to use it since it has so many features already built in."
,4,This is a super fast way to get a professionally designed flyer or other marketing piece ready to go.
,4,"I like that customer service is so great, and it looks great! Every question I have had has been answered promptly. I like that the graphics look so great, and that I can customize nearly everything."
,4,"I love how easy it is to export and view infographics, at any stage of development, as PNGs, PDFs and even interactive PDFs (with clickable hyperlinks). If something's not right, you can just tab back to the active editor window, make changes and export again. Iterate to your heart's desire!"
,4,"There is a template for everything and they are easy to tweak and customize. Plenty of font choices. It is software designed specifically for infographics, so there is no clutter and no unnecessary features."
,4,This software is easy to use. You can make very professional looking infographics in a short amount of time. There are plenty of templates to provide inspiration. I work in a school and I have been able to create displays that can grab attention and disseminate information effectively. The price isn't bad either.
,4,The infographics I've made with Venngage has made my work more noticeable.
,4, I can't afford a graphic designer in my small nonprofit and love the look and feel of the final products. The templates are awesome! I get compliments from the public and funders regularly.
,4,"Venngage is easy to use drop-and-drag, the graphics and icons are many and varied, and what you don't find as part of the software can easily be imported. Support is second-to-none."
,4,"All the complicated ideas articulated simply, visually and published online."
,4,"Venngage is very versatile and can be used to design pretty much any type of graphic. I started using it for work (creating annual reports for nonprofits to send to their donors) and now use it for lost and found flyers, dinner party menus, resumes, and much more."
,4,"Venngage provides you with the tools to turn your boring tables and charts into a story board with true meaning. The only people who will love Venngage more than you are those that previously had to make heads and tails out of your previous analytics. My data driven reports are now more widely distributed than ever before thanks to Venngage and the value of my work has therefore been enhanced. Venngage has given my reports legs within the company, circulating to areas not previously reached. On the rare occasion that you might have a question or need direction their support team is amazing and readily available. The chat mode is perfectly designed and may questions have been answered quickly and most importantly on the first try. My wife is a graphic designer by trade and when I showed her my creations with Venngage she referred to it as ""cheating""; to me that is the highest compliment from a designer."
,4,I love the diversity of templates and the user friendly way I can adapt them. The templates beautifully cover so many different ways that I can express ideas and research in university teaching.
,4,"I particularly like the many icons that you offer and the easy, very understandable use of the software. Also the selection of templates is very good. Likewise the service is excellent. If I have a problem, I write a contact person in the chat and get an answer immediately. That is awesome!"
,4,The software helped me a lot to better design presentations and reports.
,4,"I like the variety of templates and the fact that many are free. I like using the catalog of templates to help guide my thinking visually. I can see a layout in my head but the templates help me determine what's quickly doable.
